TODO
1. send/recv only power of 2 bytes?
2. try poll2, poll3 vs. poll()
 Orib says poll vs select is a little more efficient, as it doesn't overwrite the list of sockets with status.
3. make the timeout of poll(0.05) a param of stacklesssocket module
4. try the twisted method in ~/stackless

Roadmap:
Enable good expansion for the following:
1. Collision detection manner:
 - box CD for simple sprites.
 - computed CD for fixed actors like "the world boundaries", "geometric obstacles" (even non contiguous)
2. Frame calc/action
 - for moving in a pattern or algorithm
 - for making decisions - shoot, etc.
 - for moving myself in some way - vector+speed, teleport, etc.

Release Notes:
1. Uses multicast, from python-examples
/usr/share/doc/python2.4/examples/Demo/sockets/mcast.py
2. Kills an actor on quitting (not a zombie anymore.)
3. stacklesssocket.py has also some functions of network-byte orders now.
 maybe it should support all not-"socket" module items.
