Installation
============
1. Install Python 2.4 or above.
2. Install Stackless.
3. Install Pygame.
Be sure to install both onto the same Python installation.

Usage
=====
1. Run server.py. 
Specify -m to use UDP multicast.
2. Run client.py on each client machine (currently only 2 clients will work).
Again, -m for multicast.
Specify host using "-h hostname"

You will have a ship to control - move, shoot and lay mines.
A square in the middle of the window will spawn new enemy droids.
Some droids lay mines, so be careful.
You get 10 pts for shooting down a droid, 100 for a college human player.

Keyboard Input
==============
Arrows to navigate.
SPACEBAR to shoot.
M to lay a mine.
ENTER to revive ship.
ESCAPE to quit.
